# Drawing a Line Using User Input in ObjectARX Project

To draw a line using user input in your ObjectARX project using Microsoft Visual Studio, follow these steps:

## Defining a Function for User Input

1. Open your ObjectARX project.
2. Place the cursor after the line `#include "dbents.h"` and press Enter twice.
3. Add the code to define a function named `inputLine`.

   acedRegCmds->addCommand(_T("AUCommands"), _T("InputLine"), _T("InputLine"), ACRX_CMD_MODAL, inputLine);

# Saving, Building, and Loading the Project

1. Save any changes made to the project.
2. Build the project to compile the code.
3. Load the `output.arx` file into AutoCAD.

## Listing Objects in AutoCAD

1. Add some objects to the current drawing, such as lines, circles, polylines, and so on.
2. At the Command prompt, type `listobjects` and press Enter.
3. Close the AutoCAD Text Window or collapse the Command Line window when done.

## Unloading the output.arx File

Unload the `AU2014.arx` file from AutoCAD.

Adjust paths and settings according to your specific environment.
